# Project files and compiler configuration using ``dsconfig.xml``

A "project" is a collection of Dassie source files that are all compiled into a single assembly. The Dassie project system is based on the central project file ``dsconfig.xml`` that lies in the root directory of every project and is used to configure compiler settings. The content of such a file looks like this:
````xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<DassieConfig FormatVersion="1.0">
  <!--Settings, references and build profiles, see below-->
</DassieConfig>
````
The following documentation is about format version 1.0, which is the most recent version. Once the format is updated, the documentation for old versions will be archived in this repository.

## General settings
These settings are at the top level of the XML tree and configure the behavior of the compiler as well as resources associated with the project.

## Build profiles
Build profiles are used in combination with the ``dc build [BuildProfile]`` command and configure the scope of a build as well as custom settings and build events. Here is an example of a build profile:
````xml
<BuildProfiles>
  <BuildProfile Name="BuildAndLog">
    <Arguments>build</Arguments>
    <PostBuildEvents>
      <BuildEvent>
        <Command>echo. >> build.log &amp; echo Build finished at %time% on $(Date). >> build.log</Command>
      </BuildEvent>
    </PostBuildEvents>
  </BuildProfile>
</BuildProfiles>
````
The above example first launches the compiler with the default arguments and then appends some text to a log file after the build is completed. The following tables list all features supported by build events:

**``<BuildProfile>`` object**
|Name|Type|Allowed values|Description|
|---|---|---|---|
|``Name``|Attribute|Any string|Sets the name of the build profile.|
|``Arguments``|Element|Any string|Sets the arguments with which the compiler is invoked when the build profile is executed.|
|``Settings``|Element|Children of the ``<DassieConfig>`` object|Allows overriding the compiler settings from the table above.|
|``PreBuildEvents``|Element|A list of ``<BuildEvent>``s|A list of build events executed before the project is being built.|
|``PostBuildEvents``|Element|A list of ``<BuildEvent>``s|A list of build events executed after the project has been built.|


**``<BuildEvent>`` object**
|Name|Type|Allowed values|Description|
|---|---|---|---|
|``Critical``|Attribute|``true`` or ``false``|If ``true``, the compiler emits an error if the command returns a non-zero exit code. Otherwise, a warning is emitted. ``true`` by default.|
|``Hidden``|Attribute|``true`` or ``false``|If ``true``, the command is run in the background without a visible output. ``false`` by default.|
|``RunAsAdministrator``|Attribute|``true`` or ``false``|If ``true``, the command runs with full privileges. ``false`` by default.|
|``WaitForExit``|Attribute|``true`` or ``false``|If ``true``, the compiler waits for the command to finish execution before continuing. If disabled, no error or warning messages regarding the exit code are emitted. ``false`` by default.|
|``Command``|Element|Any string|The command that is executed when the build event is run.|

## Debug profiles
Debug profiles are used by a debugging environment to configure arguments passed to the debuggee. Their markup structure looks like this:
````xml
<DebugProfiles>
  <DebugProfile Name="Default">
    <Arguments>file.txt</Arguments>
    <WorkingDirectory>.\child</WorkingDirectory>
  </DebugProfile>
</DebugProfiles>
````
``<DebugProfile>`` has the following options:
|Name|Type|Allowed values|Description|
|---|---|---|---|
|``Name``|Attribute|Any string|Sets the name of the profile.|
|``Arguments``|Attribute|Any string|Sets the command-line arguments passed to the debuggee.|
|``WorkingDirectory``|Attribute|Any string|Sets the directory the debuggee is launched in.|

## Ignoring compiler messages
The ``<IgnoredMessages>`` object is used to disable specific compiler error codes. Only information and warning messages can be ignored. To disable a message, add a child node corresponding to the kind of message that is to be disabled (information, warning) containing its error code. A list of error codes can be found [here](./Errors.md).
````xml
<IgnoredMessages>
  <Message>DS0070</Message>
</IgnoredMessages>
````

## References
References are used to declare dependencies on assemblies, other Dassie projects or NuGet packages. Here is an example:
````xml
<References>
  <AssemblyReference>C:\libs\sdk.dll</AssemblyReference>
  <ProjectReference>%userprofile%\Projects\Library\dsconfig.xml</ProjectReference>
  <PackageReference Version="2.4.1">Package01</PackageReference>
</References>
````
The structure of these elements is described below.

**``<AssemblyReference>`` object**
|Name|Type|Allowed values|Description|
|---|---|---|---|
|``CopyToOutput``|Attribute|``true`` or ``false``|Determines wheter or not to copy the referenced file to the build output directory. ``true`` by default.|
||Text|Any string|The path to the referenced file.|

**``<ProjectReference>`` object**
|Name|Type|Allowed values|Description|
|---|---|---|---|
|``CopyToOutput``|Attribute|``true`` or ``false``|Determines wheter or not to copy the output of the referenced project to the build output directory. ``true`` by default.|
||Text|Any string|The project file of the referenced project.|

**``<PackageReference>`` object**
|Name|Type|Allowed values|Description|
|---|---|---|---|
|``Version``|Attribute|Any string|Determines which version of the package to reference.|
||Text|Any string|The NuGet package ID of the referenced package.|

## Resources
There are two kinds of resources which can be included in a .NET assembly: **Native** (unmanaged) resources, which are stored in the ``.rsrc`` section of the PE file and are handled by the operating system, and **managed** resources that are handled by the .NET runtime. Here is an example:
````xml
<Resources>
  <UnmanagedResource>version.res</UnmanagedResource>
  <ManagedResource Name="Painting">image.png</ManagedResource>
</Resources>
````
These two types of resources have the following options:

**``<UnmanagedResource>`` object**
|Name|Type|Allowed values|Description|
|---|---|---|---|
||Text|Any string|The path to the resource file.|

**``<ManagedResource>`` object**
|Name|Type|Allowed values|Description|
|---|---|---|---|
|``Name``|Attribute|Any string|An alias that identifies the resource inside the program.|
||Text|Any string|The path to the resource file.|

## Version information
Version information is used to display metadata about the program. It is visible in the 'Details' tab of a file's properties in Windows.
````xml
<VersionInfo>
  <Description>My program</Description>
  <Copyright>(C) 2024 My company</Copyright>
</VersionInfo>
````
These fields are supported by the ``<VersionInfo>`` object:
|Name|Description|
|---|---|
|``Description``|A short description of the application.|
|``Product``|The product name of the application.|
|``InternalName``|The internal name of the application.|
|``Company``|The author of the application.|
|``Copyright``|A copyright string.|
|``Trademark``|Trademarks owned by the company.|
|``Version``|The product version of the application.|
|``FileVersion``|The file version of the application.|

## Macros
Macros are identifiers that are replaced with a specific value by the compiler before the start of the compilation. In addition to a set of predefined macros, a project file can contain custom macro declarations. Macro names are always case-insensitive. Here is an example of how macros are used:
````xml
<VersionInfo>
  <!--Assuming the year is 2024, this will be expanded to "(C) 2024 My company".-->
  <Copyright>(C) $(Year) My company</Copyright>
</VersionInfo>
````

### Predefined macros
|Macro name|Description|
|----|----|
|``$(Time)``|The current time at the start of the build, formatted as ``HH:mm``.|
|``$(TimeExact)``|The current time at the start of the build, formatted as ``HH:mm:ss.ffff``.|
|``$(Date)``|The current date.|
|``$(Year)``|The current year.|
|``$(CompilerDirectory)``|The path to the directory containing the Dassie Compiler executable.|
|``$(CompilerPath)``|The path to the Dassie Compiler executable (dc.dll).|
|``$(ProjectDir)``|The absolute path to the root directory of the current project.|
|``$(ProjectName)``|The name of the current project.|
|``$(OutputDir)``|The absolute path to the build output directory of the current project.|


> [!IMPORTANT]
> Be careful when using the ``$(Time)`` and ``$(TimeExact)`` macros inside build events. Since all macros are evaluated before the build starts, the value of these macros will stay the same between pre-build and post-build events. On Windows, you can use the ``%time%`` variable to accurately retrieve the current time instead.


### Custom macros
Custom macros are contained in the ``<MacroDefinitions>`` tag. Here is an example of how to use them:
````xml
<MacroDefinitions>
  <Define Macro="Author">My company</Define>
</MacroDefinitions>

<VersionInfo>
  <Company>$(Author)</Company>
</VersionInfo>
````

## Importing project files
The ``Import`` attribute can be used on the ``<DassieConfig>`` object to specify a configuration file to inherit settings from. When the compiler encounters this attribute, it loads the specified configuration file and applies all settings to the current configuration file. If the current file already contains a setting that is set by the imported configuration file, the inherited value is overwritten.
````xml
<!--measurements.xml-->
<DassieConfig>
  <MeasureElapsedTime>true</MeasureElapsedTime>
</DassieConfig>

<!--dsconfig.xml-->
<DassieConfig Import="measurements.xml">
  <ApplicationType>Library</ApplicationType>
  <!--...-->
</DassieConfig>
````
Besides configuration files, the ``Import`` attribute also supports **configuration providers** from compiler extensions.

## Transient extensions
With **transient extensions**, projects can declare dependencies on Dassie compiler extensions. These extensions will then be active during the build process only. Additionally, the extension behavior can be customized with XML attributes and elements.

Transient extensions are declared in the ``<Extensions>`` tag, like in the following example:
````xml
<Extensions>
  <Extension Path="./tools/Extension1.dll"/>
  <Extension Path="./tools/Extension2.dll" CustomConfig="10"/>
</Extensions>
````

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Not every extension can be loaded in transient mode. Extension developers can customize which "loading modes" are supported.
