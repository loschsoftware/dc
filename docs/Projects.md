# Project files and compiler configuration using ``dsconfig.xml``

A "project" is a collection of Dassie source files that are all compiled into a single assembly. The Dassie project system is based on the central project file ``dsconfig.xml`` that lies in the root directory of every project and is used to configure compiler settings. The content of such a file looks like this:
````xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<DassieConfig FormatVersion="1.0">
  <!--Settings, references and build profiles, see below-->
</DassieConfig>
````
The following documentation is about format version 1.0, which is the most recent version. Once the format is updated, the documentation for old versions will be archived in this repository.

## General settings
These settings are at the top level of the XML tree and configure the behavior of the compiler as well as resources associated with the project.

## Build profiles
Build profiles are used in combination with the ``dc build [BuildProfile]`` command and configure the scope of a build as well as custom settings and build events. Here is an example of a build profile:
````xml
<BuildProfiles>
  <BuildProfile Name="BuildAndLog">
    <Arguments>build</Arguments>
    <PostBuildEvents>
      <BuildEvent>
        <Command>echo. >> build.log &amp; echo Build finished at %time% on $(Date). >> build.log</Command>
      </BuildEvent>
    </PostBuildEvents>
  </BuildProfile>
</BuildProfiles>
````
The above example first launches the compiler with the default arguments and then appends some text to a log file after the build is completed. The following tables list all features supported by build events:

**``<BuildProfile>`` object**
|Name|Type|Allowed values|Description|
|---|---|---|---|
|``Name``|Attribute|Any string|Sets the name of the build profile.|
|``Arguments``|Element|Any string|Sets the arguments with which the compiler is invoked when the build profile is executed.|
|``Settings``|Element|Children of the ``<DassieConfig>`` object|Allows overriding the compiler settings from the table above.|
|``PreBuildEvents``|Element|A list of ``<BuildEvent>``s|A list of build events executed before the project is being built.|
|``PostBuildEvents``|Element|A list of ``<BuildEvent>``s|A list of build events executed after the project has been built.|


**``<BuildEvent>`` object**
|Name|Type|Allowed values|Description|
|---|---|---|---|
|``Critical``|Attribute|``true`` or ``false``|If ``true``, the compiler emits an error if the command returns a non-zero exit code. Otherwise, a warning is emitted. ``true`` by default.|
|``Hidden``|Attribute|``true`` or ``false``|If ``true``, the command is run in the background without a visible output. ``false`` by default.|
|``RunAsAdministrator``|Attribute|``true`` or ``false``|If ``true``, the command runs with full privileges. ``false`` by default.|
|``WaitForExit``|Attribute|``true`` or ``false``|If ``true``, the compiler waits for the command to finish execution before continuing. If disabled, no error or warning messages regarding the exit code are emitted. ``false`` by default.|
|``Command``|Element|Any string|The command that is executed when the build event is run.|

## Debug profiles
Debug profiles are used by a debugging environment to configure arguments passed to the debuggee. Their markup structure looks like this:
````xml
<DebugProfiles>
  <DebugProfile Name="Default">
    <Arguments>file.txt</Arguments>
    <WorkingDirectory>.\child</WorkingDirectory>
  </DebugProfile>
</DebugProfiles>
````
``<DebugProfile>`` has the following options:
|Name|Type|Allowed values|Description|
|---|---|---|---|
|``Name``|Attribute|Any string|Sets the name of the profile.|
|``Arguments``|Attribute|Any string|Sets the command-line arguments passed to the debuggee.|
|``WorkingDirectory``|Attribute|Any string|Sets the directory the debuggee is launched in.|

## Ignoring compiler messages
The ``<IgnoredMessages>`` object is used to disable specific compiler error codes. Only information and warning messages can be ignored. To disable a message, add a child node corresponding to the kind of message that is to be disabled (information, warning) containing its error code. A list of error codes can be found [here](./Errors.md).
````xml
<IgnoredMessages>
  <Message>DS0070</Message>
</IgnoredMessages>
````

## References
References are used to declare dependencies on assemblies, other Dassie projects or NuGet packages. Here is an example:
````xml
<References>
  <AssemblyReference>C:\libs\sdk.dll</FileReference>
  <ProjectReference>%userprofile%\Projects\Library\dsconfig.xml</ProjectReference>
  <PackageReference Version="2.4.1">Package01</PackageReference>
</References>
````
The structure of these elements is described below.

**``<AssemblyReference>`` object**
|Name|Type|Allowed values|Description|
|---|---|---|---|
|``CopyToOutput``|Attribute|``true`` or ``false``|Determines wheter or not to copy the referenced file to the build output directory. ``true`` by default.|
||Text|Any string|The path to the referenced file.|

**``<ProjectReference>`` object**
|Name|Type|Allowed values|Description|
|---|---|---|---|
|``CopyToOutput``|Attribute|``true`` or ``false``|Determines wheter or not to copy the output of the referenced project to the build output directory. ``true`` by default.|
||Text|Any string|The project file of the referenced project.|

**``<PackageReference>`` object**
|Name|Type|Allowed values|Description|
|---|---|---|---|
|``Version``|Attribute|Any string|Determines which version of the package to reference.|
||Text|Any string|The NuGet package ID of the referenced package.|

## Resources
There are two kinds of resources which can be included in a .NET assembly: **Native** (unmanaged) resources, which are stored in the ``.rsrc`` section of the PE file and are handled by the operating system, and **managed** resources that are handled by the .NET runtime. Here is an example:
````xml
<Resources>
  <UnmanagedResource>version.res</UnmanagedResource>
  <ManagedResource Name="Painting">image.png</ManagedResource>
</Resources>
````
These two types of resources have the following options:

**``<UnmanagedResource>`` object**
|Name|Type|Allowed values|Description|
|---|---|---|---|
||Text|Any string|The path to the resource file.|

**``<ManagedResource>`` object**
|Name|Type|Allowed values|Description|
|---|---|---|---|
|``Name``|Attribute|Any string|An alias that identifies the resource inside the program.|
||Text|Any string|The path to the resource file.|

## Version information
Version information is used to display metadata about the program. It is visible in the 'Details' tab of a file's properties in Windows.
````xml
<VersionInfo>
  <Description>My program</Description>
  <Copyright>(C) 2024 My company</Copyright>
</VersionInfo>
````
These fields are supported by the ``<VersionInfo>`` object:
|Name|Description|
|---|---|
|``Description``|A short description of the application.|
|``Product``|The product name of the application.|
|``InternalName``|The internal name of the application.|
|``Company``|The author of the application.|
|``Copyright``|A copyright string.|
|``Trademark``|Trademarks owned by the company.|
|``Version``|The product version of the application.|
|``FileVersion``|The file version of the application.|

## Macros
Macros are identifiers that are replaced with a specific value by the compiler before the start of the compilation. In addition to a set of predefined macros, a project file can contain custom macro declarations. Macro names are always case-insensitive. Here is an example of how macros are used:
````xml
<VersionInfo>
  <!--Assuming the year is 2024, this will be expanded to "(C) 2024 My company".-->
  <Copyright>(C) $(Year) My company</Copyright>
</VersionInfo>
````

### Predefined macros
|Macro name|Description|
|----|----|
|``$(Time)``|The current time at the start of the build, formatted as ``HH:mm``.|
|``$(TimeExact)``|The current time at the start of the build, formatted as ``HH:mm:ss.ffff``.|
|``$(Date)``|The current date.|
|``$(Year)``|The current year.|
|``$(ProjectDir)``|The absolute path to the root directory of the current project.|
|``$(ProjectName)``|The name of the current project.|
|``$(OutputDir)``|The absolute path to the build output directory of the current project.|


> [!IMPORTANT]
> Be careful when using the ``$(Time)`` and ``$(TimeExact)`` macros inside build events. Since all macros are evaluated before the build starts, the value of these macros will stay the same between pre-build and post-build events. On Windows, you can use the ``%time%`` variable to accurately retrieve the current time instead.


### Custom macros
Custom macros are contained in the ``<MacroDefinitions>`` tag. Here is an example of how to use them:
````xml
<MacroDefinitions>
  <Define Macro="Author">My company</Define>
</MacroDefinitions>

<VersionInfo>
  <Company>$(Author)</Company>
</VersionInfo>
````
